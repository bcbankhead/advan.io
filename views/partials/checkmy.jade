          p Synopsis:
          .mainText Initially I planned to only build the Chrome Extension, as a result 
            |I included all of a "main site" functionality within the plugin. 
            |Late game user testing (i.e. people were like "this is too hard to use") revealed that 
            |my UX left much to be desired. As much as I loved what I had done, if people were to actually 
            |use this thing it would require a rebuild, of sorts. 
          .mainText After the rebuild I was able to rapidly develop contingent UX improvements such as in-line form inputs in
            |the custom dropdowns as well as utilizing automatic article type identification to make adding articles a two-click process. 
            |I accepted the shortcomings of the original interface and actively sought user input to help turn the interface 
            |into it's current state.
          .mainText I used this experience to really understand the core use case of this plugin and I will continue to develop it 
            |with that use-case in mind. 
          p _
          p Future:
          .mainText This application may have practical merit. I will continue to develop it as well as streamline the UX.
            |Future features include live updating FashionStream, outfit "likes" through Facebook Graph, Facebook,Twitter,Twillio 
            |post/messaging to allow quick dissemination of newly minted outfits.
