          |Hello, welcome to my personal site, advan.io! Everything here has been completed during the last 
          |6 months while enrolled in an immersive full-stack development program at Galvanize Denver!
        .mainText The three projects to the left represent a reasonable picture of my progress from roughly 
          |week 7 in this course, up through and culminating with my Capstone project, CheckMyStyle. 
          |I've included the approximate time to completion as the "Duration" for each project.
